If you checkout kernel sources of version > 3.4 , you will find that both
  arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h and
  arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_64.h are gone.

Instead, they are generated using arch/x86/syscalls

==> In order to see the syscall id table you need to compile a kernel.

As a result, the files
  <kernel source>/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl
  <kernel source>/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
are generated


See directories 
 linux-source-2.6.32
 linux-source-3.5.0

for the extracted lists
